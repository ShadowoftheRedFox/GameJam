# Known bugs:

- It's possible that you can't delete a save on Windows through the game.
- Enemies can fall through doors.
- Dash mid-air without moving makes you float for a short time.
- Doing your first jump mid-air gives you "another" air-jump.
- Spamming left right while attacking gives you a higher DPS.
- Dashing through doors could not change your room.
